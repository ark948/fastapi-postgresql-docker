the goal is to have less and less parameters on the docker command,
and move everything (as much as possible) to either Dockerfile or docker-compose file, or even runserver.py

this finally worked.
do not change anything. just commit and work on it.
make it more complicated step by step


commands: (this version that works, got it from fastapi official documentation): 001
> docker build -t myimage .
> docker run -d --name mycontainer -p 80:80 myimage





also works, 002:
(this time using docker-compose, did not provide any port parameter on command, only in docker-compose)
> docker build . (gave it no name)
> docker-compose up
(since using docker-compose no longer need to use cmd command in Dockerfile)




003:
using uvicorn,
same command as 002, only docker-compose has been changed.
also 127.0.0.1:80 as good as localhost:80
tried changing ports to 8000, works ok (003 2)




004:
trying to add run.py
this is where things failed.
even tried specify exposing host on docker run command







005:
i was able to add run.py to docker eventually
but had to use 0.0.0.0 in run.py (uvicorn.run)
and the result was accessible in 127.0.0.1:80
> docker build -t myimage .
> docker run --name mycontainer -p 80:80 myimage
