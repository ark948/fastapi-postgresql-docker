this finally worked.
do not change anything. just commit and work on it.
make it more complicated step by step


commands: (this version that works, got it from fastapi official documentation): 001
> docker build -t myimage .
> docker run -d --name mycontainer -p 80:80 myimage





also works, 002:
(this time using docker-compose, did not provide any port parameter on command, only in docker-compose)
> docker build . (gave it no name)
> docker-compose up
